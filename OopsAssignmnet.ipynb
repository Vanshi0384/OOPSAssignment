    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. This restricts direct access to the data and enforces controlled interaction through the defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on providing a simplified view of an object, hiding unnecessary details and exposing only essential functionalities. It allows users to interact with an object without worrying about its internal implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance enables creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (parent classes). Subclasses can add their own specific attributes and methods while also benefiting from the functionality of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes (but potentially sharing a common base class) to respond differently to the same method call. This enables flexible and dynamic behavior in programs."
